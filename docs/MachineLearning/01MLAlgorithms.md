## kNN
k Nearest Neighbor classifier

1. How To  
For the query data point, find the *k* *closest* training data points,  
and predict using their labels.

2. Hyper Parameter  
*k*, *metric*

3. Issues  
   - time complexity : $O(1)$ for training, $O(n)$ for predicting
   - curse of dimensionality (exponential)
   - In computer vision, pixel-level *nearness* doesn't represent high-level similarity.
